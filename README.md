[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DMS-Aus/Roam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DMS-Aus/Roam)

IntraMaps Roam is a field data collection application built using the QGIS libraries and Python. It was built to be easy to use on (windows) based tablet devices, with Android planned for the future.

IntraMaps Roam is built as a standalone fully packaged Python application with everything included. QGIS is **not** required to be installed on the client machine and only on the machine that builds Roam from source.  Pre-built binary packages will be available after the first release.
